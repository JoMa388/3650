# IV. Tasks:
## A. Core Tasks
1. Create a website using HTML and Bootstrap (use the starter template and include the
responsive meta-tag to make your site responsive on mobile devices). (2 pts)
2. Add a list of tasks and use CSS to format the list so that it is a well-designed to do list. Be
thoughtful and intentional about your design. (2 pts)
3. Allow the user to add items to the to do list. (This will require additional HTML elements
as well as JavaScript.) (2 pts)
4. Allow the user to indicate completion of a task (e.g. check off, cross out) and removal
from the list. (2 pts)
5. Allow the user to delete tasks from the list. (Note that this is not the same as completing
tasks; the user may decide that it was an error to have included the tasks in the first
place.) (2 pts)

## B. Make it Better
7. Allow users to associate a due date with a task and display the due dates next to the
tasks. (Use <input type="date"> for the date input.) (2 pts)
8. Allow users to “un-complete” items that were accidentally checked off. (1 pts)
   
## C. Even Better
9. Allow users to color code tasks to indicate priority or type of task. (2 pts)
10. Give some sort of celebratory recognition when users complete a task – visual or sound
or both – beyond the simple feedback of the check/cross out. (See Google Tasks for an
example.) Again, be thoughtful and deliberate about your design. (1 pt)

## D. Cherry on Top:
Allow users to define subtasks. Subtasks should be able to be checked off/deleted
individually OR checked off /deleted together with the super-task. (1 pt)

###V. Grading Details:
The following are a prerequisite to my grading your assignment. (If these conditions are not met,
it’s an automatic zero):
● Use of GitHub and GitHub pages
● Inclusion of a list of clear citations to resources used in completing this assignment
● A clear list of which tasks you have completed
Completing the written document ((B) in Assignment Details) and (A) in “Tasks” counts for 65%
of your grade; adding (B) brings you to 80%, (C), to 95% and (D), to 100%.
Note that the design of the interface is part of the grade, not just the functionality
